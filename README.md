# Table2
This is a version of the [Table Tool CSV editor](https://github.com/jakob/TableTool/blob/master/LICENSE) rebuilt with SwiftUI to support tabs. It seems to work, but note that the code was AI-generated so I take no responsibility for (and claim no ownership over) it.

## Credits
Table2 was generated by Claude 4 Sonnet based on the source code of Table Tool by [Sandro Peham](https://github.com/SandroPeham), [Andreas Aigner](https://github.com/aigi) and [Jakob Egger](https://github.com/jakob).
